# SMILE IT Solutions - Frontend Coding Challenge'

Welcome to the repository for coding challenges used in the interview process for SMILE IT Solutions. In this repository you should have access to at least 1 coding challenge and 1 bug fix challenge. The detailed description of each challenge is present in the README file in the corresponding folder.

The aim for the coding challenge is for us to get a glimpse of your coding style and the standards you follow in your implementation. You can add any library or tool that you see fit and you can also stay away from using any libraries but you should of course have a good reason for your choice either way.

Feel free to contact us at poorya@smileitsolutions.uk if you have any questions or you need further clarification on any of the challenges.
